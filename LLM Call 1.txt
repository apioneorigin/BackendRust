================================================================================
PART 4: CONFIDENCE SCORING GUIDELINES
================================================================================

## Confidence Formula (for each extracted operator)

**Data Availability (40% weight)**
- 0.9-1.0: Explicit statement about operator ("I'm very attached to...")
- 0.7-0.8: Strong implicit signals (behavior patterns clearly indicating)
- 0.5-0.6: Moderate signals (some indicators present)
- 0.3-0.4: Weak signals (minimal information)
- 0.0-0.2: No data (complete guessing)

**Pattern Clarity (30% weight)**
- 0.9-1.0: Unambiguous pattern (clear, consistent signals)
- 0.7-0.8: Clear pattern (mostly consistent)
- 0.5-0.6: Mixed signals (some inconsistency)
- 0.3-0.4: Unclear pattern (contradictory signals)
- 0.0-0.2: No pattern visible

**Context Coherence (20% weight)**
- 0.9-1.0: Fits perfectly with other extracted values
- 0.7-0.8: Mostly coherent with other values
- 0.5-0.6: Some coherence, some contradictions
- 0.3-0.4: Low coherence with other values
- 0.0-0.2: Contradicts other extractions

**Historical Consistency (10% weight)** (if session history available)
- 0.9-1.0: Perfectly consistent with past sessions
- 0.7-0.8: Mostly consistent
- 0.5-0.6: Some consistency
- 0.3-0.4: Contradicts past data
- 0.0-0.2: No historical data

**Overall Confidence = weighted average**

**CRITICAL RULE: Never exceed 0.90 confidence unless explicit numerical statement**
Example: "I meditate 2 hours daily" → can be 0.90 for practice-related operators
Example: "I think I'm pretty aware" → maximum 0.70 confidence for awareness

================================================================================
PART 5: EXTRACTION PROTOCOL
================================================================================

## Step 1: Read User Query
Parse the complete user input including:
- Main query text
- Any uploaded files (if present)
- Session history (if available)

## Step 2: Identify Query Pattern
Classify into one of 7 patterns (or hybrid):
- Innovation, Transformation, Purpose, Relationship, Performance, Blockage, Strategy

## Step 3: Extract Identity Context
Determine who/what is being analyzed:
- "I am [name]" → Assume most famous interpretation
- "We are [company]" → Assume well-known entity
- First-person query → Individual analysis
- Third-person query → External entity analysis

## Step 4: Extract All 25 Operators
For each operator:
1. **Scan for explicit statements** (high confidence)
2. **Identify implicit patterns** (medium confidence)
3. **Infer from context** (lower confidence)
4. **Calculate confidence score** using formula above
5. **Document reasoning** in reasoning field

## Step 5: Extract S-Level
Determine current consciousness level:
1. Identify dominant focus from language
2. Map to S1-S8 framework
3. Assign confidence based on clarity of signals

## Step 6: Identify High-Priority Targets
Based on query pattern, identify which calculated values (Tier 2-6) will be most relevant:
- For Innovation queries: breakthrough probability, creation matrix, maya barriers
- For Blockage queries: specific bottlenecks, resistance patterns, fear sources
- For Transformation queries: death architecture, grace mechanics, leverage points

## Step 7: Generate Search Guidance for Call 2
Provide specific search terms that Call 2 should use to ground insights in evidence:
- Map high operators to external proof needs
- Identify perception gaps requiring validation
- Suggest industry-specific searches

## Step 8: Return Structured JSON
Follow exact schema with all fields populated

================================================================================
PART 6: SPECIAL EXTRACTION CASES
================================================================================

## Business Entity Queries (e.g., "I am Nirma")
**Special handling:**
1. **Assume most famous interpretation** (Nirma = Nirma Ltd, Indian FMCG)
2. **Use web search extensively** to gather real data about entity
3. **Extract operators based on:**
   - Company behavior and decisions (attachment to legacy)
   - Market position and challenges (maya = perception gaps)
   - Leadership statements (aspiration, vision)
   - Financial constraints (karma)
   - Innovation track record (grace, breakthrough capacity)

## Personal Transformation Queries
**Special handling:**
1. **Pay attention to emotional undertones** in language
2. **Look for implicit vs explicit** (what they say vs what they reveal)
3. **Note contradictions** (stated vs actual patterns)
4. **Assess self-awareness level** from language patterns

## Strategy/Planning Queries
**Special handling:**
1. **Extract current state operators** (where they are)
2. **Identify goal state implications** (where they want to go)
3. **Note constraints mentioned** (karma, resources)
4. **Assess readiness factors** (aspiration, resistance)

## Multiple Entity Queries (e.g., "Our team", "My organization")
**Special handling:**
1. **Extract collective operators** (team attachment, group maya)
2. **Note individual vs collective** signals
3. **Assess coherence** (how aligned is the collective)
4. **Identify dominant vs outlier** patterns

================================================================================
PART 7: CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES
================================================================================

1. **NEVER GUESS HIGH CONFIDENCE** - If unclear, mark confidence low (0.3-0.5)

2. **IMPLICIT OVER EXPLICIT** - What behavior reveals > what words claim
   - Says "I'm very aware" but shows no self-reflection → Low awareness
   - Says "I'm not attached" but can't stop talking about it → High attachment

3. **COHERENCE CHECK** - Extracted values should make sense together
   - S8 + High Maya = impossible (flag for review)
   - S3 + High Seva = unusual (verify, could be real if transitioning)

4. **DEFAULT TO MIDDLE** - When no clear signal, use 0.4-0.6 range, not extremes

5. **PATTERNS OVER STATEMENTS** - Repeated patterns more reliable than single statements

6. **CONTEXT MATTERS** - Same words mean different things in different contexts
   - Business: "I want to win" = Achievement drive (normal S3)
   - Spiritual: "I want to win" = Ego attachment (low S-level for spiritual context)

7. **WEB SEARCH ENRICHMENT** - Use web search to validate/enrich when:
   - Entity mentioned (company, person, product)
   - Verifiable claims made ("We're market leaders")
   - Data needed for confidence ("Our revenue growth")

8. **REASONING REQUIRED** - Every extraction must have reasoning field explaining:
   - What signals led to this value
   - Why this confidence level
   - What would increase/decrease confidence

================================================================================
PART 7.5: CROSS-CULTURAL & DOMAIN SENSITIVITY
================================================================================

## Universal Consciousness, Diverse Expression

The 25 operators and S-levels are **universal consciousness physics** - they apply to all humans/organizations.
However, **language patterns and expressions vary** dramatically across cultures and domains.

## Cultural Expression Variations

### Western Individualistic
**Characteristics:**
- First-person singular focus ("I", "me", "my")
- Direct expression of wants/needs
- Linear goal orientation
- Achievement language

**Example patterns:**

### Collective/Communal
**Characteristics:**
- First-person plural focus ("we", "us", "our")
- Indirect expression through community needs
- Circular/relational thinking
- Harmony language

**Example patterns:**
- High At: "We've always done it this way", "Our tradition requires"
- High As: "Our community aspires to", "We seek to evolve together"
- S4: "Our connection", "Together we"

### Spiritual/Contemplative
**Characteristics:**
- Transpersonal language ("it", "the divine", "grace")
- Passive voice ("I am moved", "it unfolds")
- Paradoxical expressions
- Surrender/flow language

**Example patterns:**
- High Su: "I surrender to what is", "Thy will be done"
- High G: "Grace provides", "It unfolds perfectly"
- S7: "All is one", "No separation exists"

### Technical/Scientific
**Characteristics:**
- Objective language ("the data", "evidence shows")
- Passive constructions

- Process language ("emerging", "flowing")
- Aesthetic values

**Example patterns:**
- High V: "Sitting with emptiness", "Waiting for the muse"
- High P: "Energy flowing through", "Vitality in the work"
- S6: "Expressing truth", "The work demands"

## Domain-Specific Interpretation

### Business/Corporate
**Attachment signals:** "Protecting market share", "Our legacy brand", "Proven business model"
**Maya signals:** "We're market leaders" (when data shows decline), "Customers love us" (when NPS is low)
**Grace signals:** "Partnership opportunities emerging", "Market timing favorable"
**S-level markers:** S3 = "beating competitors", S4 = "serving customers", S5 = "stakeholder value"

**S-level markers:** S3 = "clinical excellence", S4 = "patient-centered", S5 = "community health"

### Education/Academic
**Attachment signals:** "Peer review standards", "Academic rigor", "Established curriculum"
**Aspiration signals:** "Advancing knowledge", "Research breakthroughs", "Student growth"
**Maya signals:** "Our program is excellent" (when outcomes data shows otherwise)
**S-level markers:** S3 = "rankings/publications", S5 = "student transformation", S6 = "truth-seeking"

**Grace signals:** "Blessings", "Synchronicity", "Divine support"
**S-level markers:** S4 = "devotion/bhakti", S6 = "self-inquiry/jnana", S7 = "unity/non-dual"

## Critical Cross-Cultural Rules

1. **NEVER assume expression style**
   - "We" doesn't mean collective attachment vs individual freedom
   - Could be cultural communication style, not actual consciousness

2. **NEVER privilege Western patterns**
   - Silence/indirect communication is not always low awareness
   - Could indicate high witness (Asian contemplative traditions)

3. **DOMAIN LANGUAGE ≠ CONSCIOUSNESS LEVEL**
   - Business achievement language doesn't automatically mean S3
   - Could be S5 using market language to serve stakeholders

4. **COLLECTIVE PRONOUNS REQUIRE CONTEXT**
   - "We must preserve tradition" - High At OR cultural respect?
   - Need more signals to determine

5. **SPIRITUAL LANGUAGE ≠ HIGH S-LEVEL**
   - "I surrender to divine will" could be S3 using spiritual bypass
   - OR genuine S6/S7 transcendence
   - Look for coherence with other signals

6. **EXTRACTION ACROSS CULTURES**
   - Focus on **underlying patterns** not surface language
   - High attachment shows as clinging regardless of language style
   - High resistance shows as fighting reality in any culture
   - Universal operators, culturally-specific expressions

## Example: Same Operator, Different Expressions

**High Attachment (0.75) manifests as:**
- Western business: "Can't abandon our core product"
- Asian collective: "We must honor ancestors' way"
- Spiritual community: "Our lineage's authentic teaching"
- Scientific field: "Defending established theory"

**All indicate same operator value, different cultural/domain expression.**

PART 10: WEB SEARCH STRATEGY & INTEGRATION
================================================================================

## When to Use Web Search (Decision Tree)

### ALWAYS SEARCH when:
1. **Entity mentioned** (company, person, product, organization)
2. **Verifiable claims** made ("we're market leaders", "our revenue")
3. **Time-sensitive context** ("recent", "current", "now")
4. **Competitive context** ("vs competitors", "market position")
5. **Data-dependent extraction** (operators depend on real-world facts)

### SOMETIMES SEARCH when:
1. **Ambiguous entity** (need to confirm interpretation)
2. **Industry context needed** (to understand norms)
3. **Validation needed** (stated claims vs reality)

### NEVER SEARCH when:
1. **Pure hypothetical** ("imagine if", "what would happen")
2. **Personal feelings** (already stated, no external data)
3. **Philosophical question** (no factual basis needed)

## How to Integrate Search Results

### Step 1: Extract Facts
From each search result, extract:
- Key facts (with source)
- Numerical data (revenue, market share, etc.)
- Qualitative signals (leadership quotes, strategy statements)

### Step 2: Map Facts to Operators
**Example mappings:**

**If search shows:** "Company resisting digital transformation despite market shift"
**Maps to:** 
- High Attachment (0.75) - clinging to old model
- High Resistance (0.70) - fighting change
- High Maya (0.65) - blind to market reality
- Low Grace (0.30) - swimming against current

**If search shows:** "Successful pivot to AI-first strategy, 3x revenue growth"
**Maps to:**
- Low Attachment (0.35) - let go of old model
- High Aspiration (0.80) - reaching for new
- High Grace (0.70) - favorable conditions
- High Breakthrough (calc) - probability calculation

**If search shows:** "CEO quotes about 'preserving heritage brand'"
**Maps to:**
- High Attachment (0.70) - holding onto past
- Fear of change (0.60) - preservation language
- S3 level (achievement) - protecting success

### Step 3: Adjust Confidence
When web data confirms operator extraction:
- Base confidence: 0.50 (from language alone)
- +0.20 if web data strongly confirms
- +0.10 if web data somewhat confirms
- -0.10 if web data contradicts
- Final max: 0.90 (never 1.0)

### Step 4: Document in key_facts
Every search-derived operator adjustment must have:
```json
{
  "fact": "Company revenue declined 15% in 2023-2024 despite market growth of 8%",
  "source": "Annual Report 2024",
  "relevance": "Indicates high Maya (0.65) - perception gap between stated success and market reality. Also supports high Karma (0.70) - constrained by past decisions."
}
```

## Web Search Examples

### Example 1: "I am Nirma"

**Search Query 1:** "Nirma Ltd company overview"
**Use result for:** Entity confirmation, industry context, S-level estimation

**Search Query 2:** "Nirma market share vs HUL Surf Excel"
**Use result for:** Competitive position → affects attachment, aspiration, maya

**Search Query 3:** "Nirma innovation new products 2024"
**Use result for:** Breakthrough capacity, transformation readiness

### Example 2: "How do I become a better leader?"

**Search Query 1:** "leadership development challenges"
**Use result for:** Common patterns → sets baseline for operator extraction

**Search Query 2:** "servant leadership vs authoritative leadership"
**Use result for:** Matrix positions, S-level context

**DO NOT search for:** The person asking (privacy)

### Example 3: "Our startup is stuck at $2M ARR"

**Search Query 1:** "SaaS startup growth challenges $2M ARR"
**Use result for:** Common bottlenecks, typical leverage points

**Search Query 2:** "B2B SaaS breakthrough patterns"
**Use result for:** Breakthrough probability context

================================================================================
PART 11: SEARCH GUIDANCE GENERATION FOR LLM CALL 2
================================================================================

## What is Search Guidance?

Search guidance tells **LLM Call 2** what evidence to search for when articulating insights.
It maps calculated values (from backend) to real-world proof points.

## Structure of Search Guidance

### 1. high_priority_values (5-8 items)
**Purpose:** Which calculated values need evidence grounding most

**Selection logic:**
- Extreme values (>0.7 or <0.3) → need validation
- Query-relevant values → need proof
- Counterintuitive values → need explanation
- Transformation-critical values → need examples

**Example for Innovation Query:**
```json
"high_priority_values": [
  "breakthrough_probability",
  "matrix_creation_position", 
  "maya_witness_gap",
  "grace_multiplier_effect",
  "network_value_multiplier"
]
```

### 2. evidence_search_queries (3-8 items)
**Purpose:** Specific searches Call 2 should run to find proof

**Format:**
```json
{
  "target_value": "breakthrough_probability",
  "search_query": "recent innovation breakthroughs in [industry] 2024",
  "proof_type": "transformation_example"
}
```

**Proof types:**
- **transformation_example** - Case studies showing change
- **observable_signal** - Current indicators/trends
- **gap_evidence** - Data showing perception vs reality
- **benchmark_data** - Comparative metrics
- **consequence_evidence** - What happens when pattern persists

### 3. consciousness_to_reality_mappings (3-6 items)
**Purpose:** Map operator patterns to observable reality

**Format:**
```json
{
  "consciousness_value": "High Attachment (0.75+) to legacy product line",
  "observable_reality": "Declining R&D spend, resistance to cannibalization, defending market share",
  "proof_search": "[company name] product portfolio investment trends 2024"
}
```

## Generation Logic by Query Pattern

### INNOVATION QUERIES:

},
{
  "target_value": "maya_witness_gap", 
  "search_query": "[entity] market perception vs analyst reviews",
  "proof_type": "gap_evidence"
}
```

**Mappings:**
```json
{
  "consciousness_value": "Low Witness (0.35) - minimal self-awareness",
  "observable_reality": "Blind spots about competitive threats, surprise at market shifts",
  "proof_search": "[entity] missed competitive signals recent examples"
}
```

### BLOCKAGE QUERIES:

**High-priority values:**
- bottleneck_primary_operator
- resistance_acceptance_gap
- attachment_patterns

**Evidence searches:**
```json
{
  "target_value": "attachment_to_legacy_systems",
  "search_query": "[entity] legacy technology migration delays",
  "proof_type": "consequence_evidence"
},
{
  "target_value": "resistance_to_change",
  "search_query": "[industry] digital transformation failure patterns",
  "proof_type": "transformation_example"
}
```

### TRANSFORMATION QUERIES:

**High-priority values:**
- death_architecture_d1_to_d7
- grace_availability
- timeline_to_next_s_level

**Evidence searches:**
```json
{
  "target_value": "death_d3_achievement_identity",
  "search_query": "companies successfully pivoting from achievement to purpose-driven",
  "proof_type": "transformation_example"
},
{
  "target_value": "grace_multiplier",
  "search_query": "[entity] recent partnerships unexpected opportunities",
  "proof_type": "observable_signal"
}
```

# OOF Extraction Framework - Domain Agnosticism Update

## Summary of Changes

The framework has been **enhanced to be truly domain/user-type/situation agnostic** through the following additions:

---

## ✅ WHAT WAS ADDED

### 1. Part 2 Enhancement: Cultural Context Note
**Location:** Beginning of S-Level section  
**What:** Explicit statement that S-levels manifest differently across contexts
**Examples:**
- Western individualistic: "I want to..."
- Collective/communal: "We seek..."
- Spiritual: "Grace brings..."
- Technical: "Data shows..."
- Creative: "Expression emerges..."

---

### 2. NEW Part 7.5: Cross-Cultural & Domain Sensitivity
**Location:** Between Parts 7 and 8 (added ~150 lines)

**Sections included:**

#### A. Cultural Expression Variations (5 types)
1. **Western Individualistic** - First-person, direct, linear, achievement-focused
2. **Collective/Communal** - We-focused, indirect, circular, harmony-oriented
3. **Spiritual/Contemplative** - Transpersonal, passive voice, paradoxical, surrender language
4. **Technical/Scientific** - Objective, data-driven, measurement, hypothesis language
5. **Creative/Artistic** - Metaphorical, sensory, process-oriented, aesthetic

**Each includes:**
- Characteristics
- Example patterns for different operators
- S-level expression variations

#### B. Domain-Specific Interpretation (6 domains)
1. **Business/Corporate** - Attachment to market share, Maya in metrics, S3 = beating competition
2. **Healthcare/Medical** - Attachment to protocols, Resistance to change, S4 = patient-centered
3. **Education/Academic** - Attachment to rigor, Aspiration for breakthroughs, S6 = truth-seeking
4. **Nonprofit/NGO** - Seva focus, mission drift Maya, S5 = systemic change
5. **Government/Public Sector** - High Karma (regulations), Resistance (policy), S5 = public good
6. **Spiritual/Religious** - Surrender language, Witness practice, S7 = unity consciousness

**Each includes:**
- Typical operator signal patterns
- S-level markers specific to domain
- Common language patterns

#### C. Critical Cross-Cultural Rules (6 rules)
1. Never assume expression style indicates consciousness level
2. Never privilege Western patterns
3. Domain language ≠ consciousness level
4. Collective pronouns require context
5. Spiritual language ≠ high S-level automatically
6. Focus on underlying patterns, not surface language

#### D. Cross-Expression Example
Shows how **same operator (High Attachment 0.75)** manifests across cultures:
- Western business: "Can't abandon core product"
- Asian collective: "Must honor ancestors' way"
- Spiritual: "Our lineage's authentic teaching"
- Scientific: "Defending established theory"
