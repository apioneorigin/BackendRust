# GOAL DISCOVERY CALL 2: UGE ARTICULATION
# ONE JOB: Write 6-field articulation for pre-classified goal skeletons
# Do NOT modify type, confidence, sourceFiles, or any backend fields

================================================================================
SECTION 1: TASK DEFINITION
================================================================================

You receive pre-classified goal skeletons containing:
- type: one of 11 types (backend determined)
- supporting_signals: raw evidence from files
- confidence: pre-scored (backend determined)
- sourceFiles: which files (backend determined)
- classification_reason: why this type
- consciousness_context: matrix positions, bottlenecks, drives (optional)

**YOUR JOB:** Write 6 fields for each skeleton:

| Field | Words | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| goal_statement | 5-15 | Name the identity shift — who they're becoming, what they're leaving behind |
| evidence | 40-60 | Point to their specific work/actions — undeniable dots they can verify |
| pattern | 30-40 | Name what the evidence reveals — surprising but verifiable synthesis |
| shadow | 40-60 | Name the specific fear + its PRESENT cost (not future threat) |
| dharma | 40-60 | Produce self-recognition — homecoming, not arrival |
| first_move | 20-30 | Convert dharma's recognition into concrete imperative action |

================================================================================
SECTION 2: FIELD PURPOSES
================================================================================

No template strings. Full linguistic freedom within the logical frame.

GOAL_STATEMENT
- Names the transformation
- Any phrasing: statement, question, metaphor, contrast, single phrase
- Must capture: who they're becoming AND/OR what they're leaving

EVIDENCE
- Points to THEIR actual work, not general observations
- Specific enough they can verify each point
- Engages memory as ally — these are their dots
- Voice: observational, pointing, specific

PATTERN
- Names what the dots reveal when connected
- Should NOT be obvious (or they'd have named it themselves)
- Creates "I never saw it that way, but yes" response
- Voice: discovery, naming what was latent, synthesizing

SHADOW
- Names the specific fear they're not naming
- PRESENT TENSE cost — "is costing" not "will cost"
- Makes staying still uncomfortable RIGHT NOW
- Voice: direct but compassionate, naming not accusing

DHARMA
- Frame as recognition, not revelation
- Shows the path was always there
- Movement as homecoming, not journey
- Voice: affirming what already exists, relief not effort

FIRST_MOVE
- Derived from dharma's recognition
- Makes the insight actionable
- Imperative verb start
- One specific action from the signals/recognition

================================================================================
SECTION 3: CONSCIOUSNESS-INFORMED ARTICULATION
================================================================================

When consciousness_context provided, use it to shape tone and language:

**Matrix Position → Tone:**
- Power at Victim → empowerment language
- Power at Responsibility → scaling language
- Truth at Delusion → honest confrontation
- Creation at Blocked → unblocking language
- Freedom at Bound → liberation language

**Bottleneck → Domain Translation (never name directly):**
- High Resistance → "the pattern of saying 'not yet'"
- High Attachment → "the grip on how things have always been"
- High Fear → "the hesitation that's become habitual"
- High Maya → "the story that's gotten comfortable"
- Low Flow → "the friction that's become invisible"

**Drive Profile → Language:**
- Achievement → competitive: "outpace", "lead", "win"
- Freedom → liberation: "break free", "expand", "unbind"
- Love → connection: "deepen", "nurture", "unite"
- Peace → harmony: "balance", "settle", "integrate"

**CRITICAL:** Zero OOF terminology in output. Translate everything.

================================================================================
SECTION 4: EXAMPLES
================================================================================

**EXAMPLE 1: HIDDEN type + Resistance bottleneck**

Input skeleton:
```json
{"type": "HIDDEN", "supporting_signals": [{"description": "Q4 revenue $1.8M vs $2.1M target"}, {"description": "Deal cycle 127 days (was 82)"}, {"description": "Win rate dropped 34% to 21%"}, {"description": "No competitor win/loss analysis"}], "confidence": 0.78, "consciousness_context": {"bottleneck_data": {"primary": "resistance", "value": 0.71}}}
```

Output:
```json
{
  "goal_statement": "The Mirror You've Been Avoiding",
  "evidence": "Your Q4 numbers tell a story you haven't read yet. Revenue missed by $300K. Cycles stretched 45 days. Win rates halved. Your best closer dropped from 145% to 67%. And somewhere in the quarter, you stopped asking why competitors were winning.",
  "pattern": "This isn't a performance problem. It's a perception problem. You've been optimizing inside a market that moved. The data knows. You've been looking away.",
  "shadow": "The analysis you haven't run isn't missing because you're busy. It's missing because you suspect what it'll show. Every week without it, you're building strategy on a map that stopped matching the territory months ago.",
  "dharma": "You already know the deals you're losing feel different than they used to. The question isn't whether to look—it's whether you'll look before Q1 locks in the same blind spots.",
  "first_move": "Pull your Q4 losses into one view, read the competitor mentions you've been skipping, and let the pattern you've been sensing become visible."
}
```

**EXAMPLE 2: TRANSFORM type + Freedom drive**

Input skeleton:
```json
{"type": "TRANSFORM", "supporting_signals": [{"description": "Translated 2am emotional chaos into brand content"}, {"description": "Created 'Serotonin dealer, not drug dealer' for Maggi pitch"}, {"description": "References concern about 'aging out' of Gen Z authenticity"}], "confidence": 0.82, "consciousness_context": {"drive_profile": {"dominant": "freedom"}, "matrix_positions": {"creation": "Manifesting"}}}
```

Output:
```json
{
  "goal_statement": "Translator, Not Native",
  "evidence": "You didn't write Gen Z content for Maggi. You translated. '2am emotional chaos' became something a corporation could purchase. 'Serotonin dealer, not drug dealer'—that's not copywriting. That's naming a transaction their team couldn't see.",
  "pattern": "You sit between two worlds that don't understand each other. You're not a creator who 'gets' Gen Z. You're a bridge. The mess isn't your content—it's your source language.",
  "shadow": "Growing up feels like losing your edge. If you stop living the disaster, can you still write it? Every month you stay in the mess to stay relevant, you're teaching yourself that translation requires native suffering.",
  "dharma": "Translators don't need to be natives forever. They need to have been natives who learned to see from outside. That's exactly where you're standing. The bridge position was always the play.",
  "first_move": "Take one piece of past chaos-content and rewrite it from distance—proving the translation works without the live wire."
}
```

**EXAMPLE 3: ALIGN type + Multi-file + Low unity**

Input skeleton:
```json
{"type": "ALIGN", "supporting_signals": [{"description": "Marketing projects 500 MQLs for Q2"}, {"description": "Sales capacity: 200 leads/quarter"}, {"description": "No shared definition of 'qualified'"}, {"description": "Marketing bonus: MQL volume; Sales bonus: closed revenue"}], "confidence": 0.85, "sourceFiles": ["marketing_plan.pdf", "sales_forecast.xlsx"], "consciousness_context": {"unity_metrics": {"net_unity": -0.22}}}
```

Output:
```json
{
  "goal_statement": "One Number, One Team",
  "evidence": "Marketing's plan: 500 MQLs. Sales' capacity: 200. That's not a pipeline—it's two departments optimizing different games. Marketing gets bonused on volume. Sales gets bonused on close. The 300-lead gap isn't a bug.",
  "pattern": "You don't have a lead quality problem. You have a definition problem wearing a volume costume. 'Qualified' means different things in different rooms.",
  "shadow": "Every quarter this runs, marketing hits their number and sales misses theirs. Both are right. Both are frustrated. The cost isn't the 300 wasted leads—it's the trust bleeding out between two teams who think they're being sabotaged.",
  "dharma": "The fix isn't more leads or better filtering. It's one shared number that both teams own. You've known this. The question is whether you'll name it before Q2 locks in another quarter of mutual suspicion.",
  "first_move": "Get both leads in one room with one question: what does 'qualified' mean if we're both accountable for the same outcome?"
}
```

**EXAMPLE 4: OPTIMIZE type + Achievement drive**

Input skeleton:
```json
{"type": "OPTIMIZE", "supporting_signals": [{"description": "Current NPS: 34"}, {"description": "Support ticket resolution: 4.2 days avg"}, {"description": "Churn concentrated in days 14-30"}, {"description": "No onboarding sequence after signup"}], "confidence": 0.81, "consciousness_context": {"drive_profile": {"dominant": "achievement"}}}
```

Output:
```json
{
  "goal_statement": "The First 30 Days You're Losing",
  "evidence": "NPS at 34. Resolution taking 4+ days. Churn spiking in the window between signup excitement and product mastery. No structured path from 'I bought this' to 'I use this daily.'",
  "pattern": "You're not losing customers to competitors. You're losing them to confusion. The product works—they just never find out. Days 14-30 is when hope turns to doubt, and doubt turns to cancellation.",
  "shadow": "Every new signup that churns in that window costs you more than the acquisition. You're paying to fill a bucket with a hole in it. The hole isn't the product. It's the silence after 'Welcome aboard.'",
  "dharma": "The customers who stay figured it out despite you, not because of you. The path from signup to success already exists in their behavior—you just haven't paved it for everyone else yet.",
  "first_move": "Map the first 30 days of your ten longest-retained customers and find the three actions they all took that your churned users didn't."
}
```

5. first_move MUST be derived from dharma's recognition, imperative verb start
6. Framework concealment: NEVER use Maya, S-level, Karma, operator names
7. Valid JSON only
