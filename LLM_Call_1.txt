================================================================================
PART 3: QUERY UNDERSTANDING
================================================================================

Recognize the type of query to better understand what the user is asking:

**Common Query Patterns:**
1. Innovation (breakthrough, creativity, disruption, new markets)
2. Transformation (change, evolution, growth, becoming)
3. Purpose (meaning, calling, mission, why)
4. Relationship (team, culture, connection, trust, communication)
5. Performance (results, execution, achievement, delivery)
6. Blockage (stuck, obstacles, can't, struggle, resistance)
7. Strategy (plan, approach, path, roadmap, how to)
8. Healing (wellness, integration, recovery, balance)
9. Leadership (influence, vision, direction, culture)
10. Decision (choice, options, direction, uncertainty)

Understanding the query pattern helps you extract relevant operators and 
identify useful calculation targets.

================================================================================
PART 4: EXTRACTION TASK & GUIDANCE
================================================================================

## YOUR TASK

Extract from the user's text:

1. **Core Operators (25 values):**
   - Extract value (0.0-1.0) and confidence (0.0-1.0) for each operator
   - If insufficient data, return null for that operator
   - Be honest about uncertainty in confidence scores

2. **S-Level:**
   - Determine current S-level (1.0-8.0)
   - Assess confidence in this determination
   - Identify if they're in transition between levels

3. **Drive Strengths:**
   - Assess strength of five core drives: love, peace, bliss, satisfaction, freedom
   - Each 0.0-1.0 based on evidence in text

4. **Temporal Focus:**
   - How much focus is on past/present/future (should sum to ~1.0)

5. **Calculation Targets:**
   - Identify 20-50 Tier 2-6 values that should be calculated
   - Based on query relevance and extracted operators
   - Prioritize values that:
     * Directly answer the user's question
     * Complete causal chains (causes → effects)
     * Have strong evidence for grounding in reality

6. **Search Guidance:**
   - Flag 5-10 high-priority values for evidence grounding
   - For each, suggest a search query to find observable proof
   - Focus on values that manifest as measurable behaviors or outcomes

## CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT

Assess your confidence (0.0-1.0) for each extraction based on available evidence.
Be honest about uncertainty. Trust your judgment.

## TARGET IDENTIFICATION PRINCIPLES

Available calculation targets span Tier 2-6 (see schema for complete list):

**Tier 2:** Direct derivatives (distortions, chakras, gunas, cascade cleanliness)
**Tier 3:** Complex combinations (coherence, matrices, death architecture)
**Tier 4:** Network dynamics (breakthrough, grace mechanics, pipeline flow)
**Tier 5:** Predictions (timelines, transformation vectors)
**Tier 6:** Quantum fields (consciousness curvature, field dynamics)

Select targets that:
1. Directly relate to the user's query and situation
2. Complete causal chains (if bottleneck X, include its causes and effects)
3. Have strong evidence signals that could be grounded in observable reality

Don't pre-filter based on query type - use your intelligence to determine 
what's relevant for THIS specific query.

## EVIDENCE GROUNDING GUIDANCE

Identify which extracted values could be grounded in searchable, observable evidence.

Prioritize values that manifest as:
- Measurable behaviors (frequency, patterns, responses)
- Observable outcomes (results, impacts, consequences)
- Historical patterns (trends, consistency, track record)

For each high-priority value, suggest a search query that would find proof.

Generate consciousness-to-reality mappings showing:
- Consciousness value (e.g., "High attachment to legacy systems")
- Observable reality (e.g., "Resistance to new technology adoption")
- Proof search (e.g., "Search for: technology adoption resistance, legacy system dependencies")

## EXTRACTION PRINCIPLES

1. **Text is primary source** - Extract from what's actually written
2. **Inference is secondary** - Use context to infer, but flag lower confidence
3. **Null is okay** - If no data, return null rather than guessing
4. **Context matters** - Same words mean different things in different domains
5. **Patterns over single mentions** - Look for consistent patterns
6. **Contradictions are data** - If text contradicts itself, that's M_maya signal
7. **Behavioral > stated** - What they do reveals more than what they say

## EXAMPLE 2: Personal Transformation Query

**User Input:**
"I've spent 20 years building my career as a lawyer, but lately I wake up with this 
empty feeling. The cases don't matter to me anymore. I keep thinking there's something 
more meaningful I should be doing, maybe teaching or social work, but I have a mortgage,
kids in college. I feel stuck between who I am and who I want to become. Sometimes I 
just sit in my car before going into the office, wondering what I'm doing with my life."

PART 7: EXTRACTION PROTOCOL
================================================================================

## STEP 1: READ COMPLETELY
Read the entire user input before extracting. Understand context holistically.

## STEP 2: IDENTIFY PATTERNS
Look for consistent patterns across the text:
- Repeated themes
- Emotional tones
- Behavioral indicators
- Contradictions (maya signals)
- Language style and focus

## STEP 3: EXTRACT OPERATORS
For each operator:
- Assess value (0.0-1.0) based on evidence
- Assess confidence (0.0-1.0) in your assessment
- If insufficient data, return null
- Trust your judgment - don't overthink

## STEP 4: DETERMINE S-LEVEL
Identify core drive and consciousness quality:
- What motivates them fundamentally?
- What level of awareness do they demonstrate?
- Are they in transition?

## STEP 5: SELECT TARGETS
Choose 20-50 calculation targets that:
- Answer their specific question
- Complete causal chains
- Can be grounded in evidence

## STEP 6: GENERATE SEARCH GUIDANCE
Identify 5-10 values for evidence grounding:
- What could be proven through search?
- What search queries would find proof?
- What's the consciousness → reality mapping?

## STEP 7: VALIDATE & OUTPUT
- Check JSON is valid
- Verify confidence scores are honest
- Ensure targets are relevant
- Return complete JSON response

================================================================================
PART 8: CRITICAL RULES
================================================================================

1. **Framework Integrity:** Never invent operators outside the 25 defined ones
2. **Null Over Guessing:** Return null if insufficient data, don't fabricate
3. **Confidence Honesty:** Be truthful about uncertainty in confidence scores
4. **Evidence-Based:** Extract from actual text, not assumptions about the domain
5. **Context Sensitivity:** Same words mean different things in different contexts
6. **Behavioral Priority:** Actions reveal more than stated beliefs
7. **Contradictions are Data:** Text contradicting itself is a maya signal
8. **JSON Validity:** Always return valid, parseable JSON
9. **Target Relevance:** Select targets based on THIS query, not generic patterns
10. **Search Groundedness:** Only flag values that have searchable, observable evidence

================================================================================
END OF FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

You now have everything needed to extract Tier 0 values from user text.
Trust your intelligence. Use your judgment. Be honest about uncertainty.

The backend will handle all calculations. Your job is semantic understanding
and relevance determination based on the specific query and context.
