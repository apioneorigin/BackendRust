# Bridge Implementation Logic (Core Principles Only)

## THE BRIDGE: Backend Values → LLM Articulation

---

## Principle 1: Semantic Organization

**Purpose:** Group 450 flat values by meaning, not by calculation tier.

**Categories:**
1. Core consciousness state (operators, S-level, drives)
2. Transformation readiness (breakthrough probability, timelines)
3. Active dynamics (matrix positions, death processes)
4. Energy distribution (chakras, drives internalization)
5. Obstacles (bottlenecks)
6. Opportunities (leverage points)

**Why:** LLM understands relationships between grouped values better than flat lists.

## Principle 2: Bottleneck Detection

**Logic:** Identify which operators are blocking progress.

**Detection rules:**
- Attachment-related operators >0.8 = bottleneck
- Flow-related operators <0.2 = bottleneck  
- Matrix positions at negative poles = bottleneck
- Inverse pairs (high Maya + low Witness) = bottleneck

**Output:** List of bottleneck variables with impact level.

## Principle 3: Leverage Identification

**Logic:** Calculate high-multiplier opportunities.

**Detection rules:**
- High coherence (>0.7) + Available networks + Grace (>0.4) = 1.5x-2x multiplier
- Team aligned + Innovation ready + Market timing = 1.2x-1.5x multiplier
- Grace activated + High surrender = 2x-5x multiplier

**Output:** Top 3 leverage points with activation requirements.

## Principle 4: Prompt Structure

**Send to LLM:**
1. OOF.txt framework (for interpretation reference)
2. User context from Call 1
3. Web research findings
4. Organized values (categories above)
5. Five generation instructions:
   - Current reality (where they actually are)
   - Structural gap (consciousness creating distance)
   - Root causes (which operators bottleneck)
   - Transformation pathway (what needs to shift)
   - Practical leverage (concrete actions)

**Critical requirement:** Framework concealment - no operator names in output, use domain language.

---

## Principle 5: Token Management

**If prompt exceeds limit:**
- Always include: Tier 1, bottlenecks, leverage points
- Conditionally include: Tier 2-3 if extreme values
- Summarize: Tier 4-5 as statements not raw values
- Skip: Tier 6 entirely

## That's It

The bridge is: **Organize → Detect patterns → Build prompt → Send to LLM**
